# Lesson 5: Functions

## In the prep work for this lesson, the students learned:
1. What a function is.
1. What a parameter is.
1. What an argument is.
1. How to write a function with any number of parameters.

## Announcements
1. Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any announcements!

#### For Part-Time Students:
1. If the due date for the first graded assignment has NOT already passed, remind students of the due date for the first graded assignment.
1. The grade for your first graded assignment will appear in Canvas.
1. Graded Assignment #2 is open! Remind students that the key to getting the assignment done is to read through everything carefully and start on what you can do as soon as possible. In class, read through the instructions with your students and highlight what they are capable of doing after this class.

## Large Group Time (Instructor)

### Lesson 5 Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Conversation starters:
   1. In a student's own words, can they explain what a function is?
1. When is ``undefined`` returned?
1. Live coding examples covering scope and how it impacts functions.
1. Functions calling other functions.
1. Q & A for any issues with the chapter exercises.
1. Emphasize live coding. In particular, consider creating some function tasks to give to the students as "starters" or to use in walkthroughs.
 

## Studio (TF Notes)

### Lesson 5 Studio
1. Reminder: the studio is broken into parts for a reason! Many students may read the initial paragraph and want to jump right in, but that would be doing themselves a disservice.
1. This is a problem that is possible with an inefficient, brute force solution. Encourage students who take that route to take a step back and seek out a more elegant solution.
