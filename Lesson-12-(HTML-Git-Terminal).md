## In the prep work this week (HTML, Git, Terminal), the students learned:

   1. How to add attributes and properties to HTML elements.
1. How to structure static HTML pages:
   1. doctype, ``<html>, <head>, <body>, <title>``
   1. Whitespace
1. What Git is and why we want to use a version control system (VCS).

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Announcements

1. Start working on graded assignment #4.
1. Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any other announcements.

### Lesson 12 Topics That Require More Attention

1. Don't be afraid to use the terminal!
1. Live coding:
   1. Build a simple, static web page from scratch.
   1. Accept suggestions from the students for elements, text color, etc.
   1. Note tedious aspects as they appear (e.g. making EVERY h2 red), and note that we will learn how to streamline this process in the next class.
1. Reinforce why using a VCS is a good idea. If you have a personal story that relates to this, feel free to share it!
   1. If time, initialize a simple git repo for the web page you created. Show how edits (or mistakes) can be undone with git.
1. Studio intro. Task uses browser developer tools.
1. Graded Assignment #4 is open! Remind students that the key to getting the assignment done is to read through everything carefully and start on what you can do as soon as possible. In class, read through the instructions with your students and highlight what they are capable of doing after this class.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
   1. Finding the dev tools for their particular browser version.
   1. Using copyrighted images. This is a good time to remind your students that just because something is found on the web, that does NOT mean it's free to use. If in doubt, DON'T. The safest bet would be to stick to personal images.
1. Encourage having fun! Ooooh and aaaaah as you check in with each of your students.
1. Remind your students to keep their new headlines light-hearted. The studio page has some good language around this, but you should comment on this as well.
