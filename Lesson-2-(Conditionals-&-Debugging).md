# Lesson 2: Conditionals and Debugging

## In the prep work for this lesson, the students learned:

1. The boolean data type and boolean expressions
1. Logical operators (``>``, ``<``, etc.) and ``==`` vs. ``===``
1. Logical ``AND``, ``OR``, and ``NOT``
1. ``if / else if / else`` statements
1. Three common error types (syntax, runtime, logic)
1. How to use ``console.log`` to help debug code

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Announcements

#### For Part-Time Students

1. Note the due date for the first graded assignment (should be 2 - 4 weeks away).
   1. Assignment 1 has been broken into 3 parts.  Check Canvas for the due dates for each part.
1. The assignment will be active in Canvas soon, and the students will know enough after lesson 2 to begin the first part of the assignment.

#### For Full-Time Students

* Welcome to Day 2

### Lesson 2 Topics That Require More Attention

1. Q & A from the prep work and/or exercises.
   1. Recommend walking through the debugging exercises to reinforce how to spot the different error types, how to use error messages to find bugs, and how to systematically find and fix logic errors.
1. Emphasize why ``===`` should be used instead of ``==``.
1. Review the meaning of the truth tables for logical ``AND`` and logical ``OR``.
1. Clarify with live coding examples:
   1. The difference between an ``if / else if`` block and two successive ``if`` blocks
   1. Nested conditionals
   1. Check multiple conditions with ``&&`` and ``||``
   1. When would we use ``!``?
1. The studio is a *non-coding* activity.
   1. Refer to the TF Notes and prepare a brief intro about why this activity will benefit the students.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Even though this is a non-coding studio, it requires more preparation and thought than usual.
1. The studio helps the students build confidence and identify what they want to get out of this class, so it is critical that you play your part well.
1. Refer to the notes you received from LaunchCode as you prepare for and run the studio. You can also access the notes [here](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki/blob/master/wiki-materials/Goal-Setting-and-Mindset-TA-Notes.pdf).
