### Lesson 11 Topics That Require More Attention

1. Q & A for making the class methods work in the exercises.
1. Review the difference between a *class* and an *object*.
1. Live code the creation of a class (e.g. ``Car``):
   1. Syntax review,
   1. Use ``constructor`` to add properties,
   1. Create two ``Car`` objects with ``new``.
1. Emphasize the difference between adding a method within ``constructor`` vs. outside of ``constructor``. When should each approach be used?
1. Live code an inheritance example.
   1. Inheritance is an abstract concept, and the students need practice setting it up.
1. Studio intro.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
   1. Some students might try to use object literals instead of the ``CrewCandidate`` class to create the three required objects. Reinforce the benefits of declaring and using a class.
   1. Be prepared to review the syntax for ``constructor``, as well as how to define properties and methods within a class.
   1. It has been a little while since students needed to use ``Math.round`` to round a number to 1 decimal place. Be prepared to help the students accomplish this.
1. Encourage students who finish early to complete the Bonus Mission or start the prep work for next class.
1. As always, check in with each of your students.
