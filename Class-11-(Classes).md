## In the prep work this week (Classes), the students learned:

1. What a JavaScript **class** represents.
   1. Proper syntax
   1. Differences between a class and an object
1. How to declare a class and:
   1. Add methods and properties,
   1. How to use ``constructor`` and ``this``.
1. Create new objects from a class.
1. Inheritance.

## Large Group Time (Instructor Notes)

### Announcements

1. Reminder that the third graded assignment is due just before the start of the next class.
1. Students will soon need to install some software in order to complete upcoming chapters. Encourage them to contact their TFs if they have trouble with the process.
1. Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any other announcements.

### Class 11 Topics That Require More Attention

1. Q & A for making the class methods work in the exercises.
1. Review the difference between a *class* and an *object*.
1. Live code the creation of a class (e.g. ``Car``):
   1. Syntax review,
   1. Use ``constructor`` to add properties,
   1. Create two ``Car`` objects with ``new``.
1. Emphasize the difference between adding a method within ``constructor`` vs. outside of ``constructor``. When should each approach be used?
1. Live code an inheritance example.
   1. Inheritance is an abstract concept, and the students need practice setting it up.
1. Studio intro.

## Studio (TF Notes)

1. Common student stumbling blocks:
   1. Some students might try to use object literals instead of the ``CrewCandidate`` class to create the three required objects. Reinforce the benefits of declaring and using a class.
   1. Be prepared to review the syntax for ``constructor``, as well as how to define properties and methods within a class.
   1. It has been a little while since students needed to use ``Math.round`` to round a number to 1 decimal place. Be prepared to help the students accomplish this.
1. Encourage students who finish early to complete the Bonus Mission or start the prep work for next class.
1. As always, check in with each of your students.
