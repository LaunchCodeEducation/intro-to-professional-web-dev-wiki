NOTE: This repo does NOT have a .md extension so it does NOT show up on the wiki.

This repo exists to create feature branches and PRs for
the Intro to Professional Web Dev Wiki https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-web-dev-curriculum/wiki.

# History
The repo behind https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-web-dev-curriculum/wiki is not a normal repo.
That repo can NOT be seen via the GitHub UI, therefore it does NOT allow for creating PRs.

We wanted PRs for two reasons
1. QA process for the TechEd team
2. Allow contributions from outside the TechEd team by forking and submitting a PR

# Created intro-to-professional-web-dev-wiki Repo (this repo)
Any additions or updates that need to appear on https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-web-dev-curriculum/wiki
should be committed to this repo. Create feature branches and PRs.

# Deploying to the Wiki
To deploy new commits to the visible wiki https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/intro-to-professional-web-dev/wiki,
1. Create a PR for your feature branch (a PR could also be created by someone outside of the TechEd team who has forked the repo)
2. Have the PR reviewed, approved, and then merged
3. run the ./deploy-to-wiki.sh in the root of this repo
