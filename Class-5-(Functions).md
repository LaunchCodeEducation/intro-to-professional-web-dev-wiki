1. What an argument is.
1. How to write a function with any number of parameters.
1. How to call a function.

## Announcements
1. Check with your class Candidate Engagement Manager for any announcements!
1. The first graded assignment is due before next class!

## Large Group Time (Instructor)
### Reminders
1. The grade for your first graded assignment will appear in Canvas.

### Class 5 Topics That Require Careful Attention
1. Conversation starters:
   1. In a student's own words, can they explain what a function is?
1. When is ``undefined`` returned?
1. Live coding examples covering scope and how it impacts functions.
1. Functions calling other functions.
1. Q & A for any issues with the chapter exercises.
1. Emphasize live coding. In particular, consider creating some function tasks to give to the students as "starters" or to use in walkthroughs.

## Studio (TF Notes)

### Class 5 Studio
1. Reminder: the studio is broken into parts for a reason! Many students may read the initial paragraph and want to jump right in, but that would be doing themselves a disservice.
1. This is a problem that is possible with an inefficient, brute force solution. Encourage students who take that route to take a step back and seek out a more elegant solution.
1. Students should access the studio via repl.it, NOT the online textbook.
