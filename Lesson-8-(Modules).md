### Lesson 8 Topics That Require Careful Attention

1. Reinforce possible use cases with modules.
1. Double check that no one had any questions about npm. Remind students that npm is a valuable life skill for anyone pursuing a programming career.

1. How to structure the "path" when importing a module.

1. Non-coding studio intro. The studio is about imposter syndrome. Ask if anyone has felt like they did not belong. PEP TALK!
1. Graded Assignment #3 is open! Remind students that the key to getting the assignment done is to read through everything carefully and start on what you can do as soon as possible. In class, read through the instructions with your students and highlight what they are capable of doing after this class.
